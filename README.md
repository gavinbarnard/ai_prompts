AI prompts I've written

They are either used for the System Entry, or will specifically indicate any pretrain user/assistant responses.

Unforunately most of my pretrains include code I cannot.   I would suggest augmenting your prompts with a demo user question and expected assistant response to better condition ChatGPT4.
